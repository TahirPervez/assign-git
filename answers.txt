What does fast-forward in git mean?
	In git, a fast forward means that a branch is not a diverged branch of the branch it is being merged into. ie, if you make a branch from master and then modify it, if no one has altered master than merging into master is a fast forward. But if someone has altered master in the time between you pulling and merging, there will be divergences and master cannot be fast forwarded.
